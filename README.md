# RISC-V 32b
Date : 26/12/2020.

Class subject: EE3043 Computer Structure

Project: CPU RISC-V 32b Designing.

Decrisption: Design a CPU single cycle and pipeline based on CPU RV32.

Simulator: Modelsim PE student version 10.4a.

Further infomation in pdf file

What i achieved:

    - Successfully run almost every instructions in CPU RV32.

    - Pass all the testcase teacher has given on Single Cycle: simple load store, fibonanci number, factorial number.
 
    - Pass most of the testcase teacher has given on Pipeline 5 stage : simple load store, data hazard, fibonanci number, factorial number, sorted number (from small to big).
    
What i didn't pass:

    - Completely all the instructions in CPU RV32, especially on Load and Store segments.
   
    - Run correctly the final testcase on Single Cycle, especially on Store part - didn't complete in 1 cycle.
   
    - Run correctly complicated testcase on Pipeline: didn't solve Load instruction hazard and Control hazard.
